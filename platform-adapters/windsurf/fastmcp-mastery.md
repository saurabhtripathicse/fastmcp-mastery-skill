# FastMCP Mastery Rule

Use this rule when the task is about FastMCP servers/clients, transports, auth/OAuth, providers, transforms, tasks, or CLI/config.

1. Read `__SKILL_PATH__/SKILL.md`.
2. Follow the request-routing table to load only the needed reference files.
3. Validate behavior against source code and tests before suggesting changes.
4. Include concrete file paths for docs, source, examples, and tests in responses.
