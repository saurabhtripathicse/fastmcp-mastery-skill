Apply this rule when a request involves FastMCP servers/clients, transports, auth/OAuth, providers, transforms, tasks, or CLI/config.

1. Load `__SKILL_PATH__/SKILL.md`.
2. Route to the smallest matching reference from `__SKILL_PATH__/references/`.
3. Ground output with concrete docs, source, example, and test paths.
4. Prefer runnable snippets over speculative guidance.
