# FastMCP Mastery

When a request is related to FastMCP implementation, debugging, transports, auth/OAuth, providers, transforms, tasks, or CLI/config:

1. Load `__SKILL_PATH__/SKILL.md`.
2. Route to the smallest relevant reference in `__SKILL_PATH__/references/`.
3. Ground guidance with specific docs, source, examples, and tests.
4. Prefer concrete commands/snippets and avoid assumptions not verified in code.
